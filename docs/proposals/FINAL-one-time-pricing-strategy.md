## Price Point: $34.99

### Why $34.99?

1. **Revenue optimized**: Models show $34.99 generates strong net revenue with higher conversion potential
2. **Under $35 threshold**: Psychologically feels accessible and reasonable
3. **Strong competitive position**:
   - 46% cheaper than Structured ($64.99)
   - 56% cheaper than Things 3 (~$80)
   - Equivalent to 7 months of Todoist Pro
4. **Accessible entry point**: Lower barrier to purchase encourages conversions
5. **Discount flexibility**: Room for sales without going unprofitably low

### Launch Strategy

| Period                  | Price  | Purpose                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Public Beta             | $9.99  | Early adopter reward, community building |
| Post-Beta (Standard)    | $34.99 | Regular pricing                          |
| Black Friday / New Year | $24.99 | Seasonal promotions                      |

**Rule:** Never exceed $34.99. Only discount down.

## Trial: 14 Days

### Why 14 Days?

| Factor                  | Rationale                                                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Habit formation**     | 10-14 repetitions solidify the evening planning routine         |
| **Full cycle coverage** | User experiences two full weeks of weekday and weekend planning |
| **Generous evaluation** | Ample time to truly experience the value without pressure       |
| **Higher conversion**   | Longer trials often lead to better conversion rates             |

### Trial Experience

- Full access to all features
- No credit card required upfront
- Subtle "X days remaining" indicator
- Evening planning reminders active (core habit formation)

---

## Post-Trial: Soft Lock with Grace Period

### Timeline

| Period           | Days  | User Experience                                |
| ---------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Trial**        | 1-14  | Full access                                    |
| **Grace Period** | 15-21 | Read-only (view past plans, cannot create new) |
| **Full Lock**    | 22+   | Paywall only, no app access                    |

### Why This Approach?

**Grace Period Benefits:**

- Preserves user's data investment (they see what they'll lose)
- Creates urgency without feeling punitive
- Allows time for purchase decision/budgeting
- Reduces angry uninstalls and negative reviews

**Full Lock Benefits:**

- Final urgency driver
- Clear value proposition (pay = access)
- Prevents indefinite freeloading

### Push Notification Strategy

| Day | Message                                                         |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 14  | "Your trial ends tonight! Plan your tomorrow one more time."    |
| 15  | "Your trial ended, but your plans are safe. View them anytime." |
| 17  | "Missing your evening planning routine? Unlock Domani forever." |
| 20  | "Last chance: Your plans will be locked in 2 days."             |
| 22  | "Your plans are now locked. Restore access for $34.99."         |
| 37  | "Still thinking about it? Your 14 evening plans are waiting."   |

---

## Updates: Forever

### Policy

> "All Domani features and updates, forever."

### Why Forever?

1. **Strongest marketing message**: "Own it forever" resonates in subscription-fatigued market
2. **Bounded scope**: Domani is intentionally simple; maintenance is manageable
3. **Competitive edge**: Things 3 charges for major versions; we don't
4. **Trust building**: Genuine loyalty from users who feel respected
5. **Practical reality**: Most apps evolve significantly within 3-5 years anyway

### Future Product Caveat

If building genuinely new products (Domani Teams, Domani Web, Domani 2.0 with AI), these would be separate purchases. The "forever" promise applies to the core Domani app.

**Marketing language:**

> "All Domani features and updates, forever. If we ever build something entirely new, we'll let you know—but this app is yours for life."

## Revenue Projections

### Year 1 Scenarios (50,000 trial downloads)

| Scenario     | Conversion | Purchases | Gross Revenue | Net (after 30% fee) |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Conservative | 6%         | 3,000     | $104,970      | $73,479             |
| Moderate     | 10%        | 5,000     | $174,950      | $122,465            |
| Optimistic   | 14%        | 7,000     | $244,930      | $171,451            |

### Comparison to Subscription Model

| Model                        | Year 1 Revenue | Recurring? | Churn Risk      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| Subscription (original plan) | $350,000       | Yes        | 46% first-cycle |
| One-Time (moderate)          | $122,465 net   | No         | None            |

**Trade-off:** Lower Year 1 revenue, but simpler model, no churn, stronger word-of-mouth, and differentiated market position.
