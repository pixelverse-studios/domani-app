# Beta Update Email - Task Rollover Feature

**Subject:** You've been shaping something special (+ a peek at what's next)

---

Hey there,

First, thank you. Seriously. You took a chance on Domani when it was just an idea about planning differently, and your feedback has been shaping this app into something real.

## What you've seen recently

You might have noticed things looking a little different lately. We rolled out a new sage theme—think muted earth tones instead of bold blues. It wasn't just a visual refresh. The old colors felt urgent, almost pushy. The sage palette is calmer, more grounded. Because planning your day shouldnt feel like your app is yelling at you.

The philosophy is simple: support intentional work without visual overwhelm. You're already making conscious choices about tomorrow. Your tools should respect that.

We also added per-task reminders. You asked for them, we built them. Now you can set a specific time for each task instead of hoping you remember when it matters.

## What's coming next: Task Rollover

Here's the thing we've been wrestling with: what happens when you dont finish everything you planned yesterday?

Right now, those tasks just... disappear into the past. You have to manually recreate them if you still care. That's friction you shouldnt need.

But auto-rollover everything? Thats worse. Suddenly you're dragging around a backlog of stuff you never quite got to, and planning feels like housekeeping instead of intention-setting.

So we built something in between.

**Task Rollover lets you choose.**

It works at two key moments:

**In the morning:** When you open Domani for the first time each day, if you had incomplete tasks yesterday, you'll see a simple prompt. Your Most Important Task from yesterday appears at the top with a star. Other incomplete tasks sit below it. You pick which ones deserve another day.

**During evening planning:** When your planning reminder goes off (say, 6pm), and you have incomplete tasks from today, you'll see a gentle prompt before you start planning tomorrow. But here's the smart part—it only shows tasks you clearly missed (that 4pm dentist call) or unscheduled tasks. Tasks with reminders still in the future (your 7pm meditation) don't show up because they haven't failed yet.

Maybe that quarterly report still matters. Check it, carry it forward, keep it as todays MIT (or tomorrows, if youre planning ahead).

Maybe that "organize desk drawer" task was never actually important. Leave it unchecked. Start fresh.

The details come with you—category, priority, reminders all preserved (adjusted to the right day, obviously). But you're making a conscious choice, not inheriting leftovers by default.

And if you finished everything? The app celebrates with you. Because that deserves recognition.

This isnt about managing an endless to-do list. Its about choosing what matters, informed by what you didnt finish, without the guilt or overwhelm of automatic inheritance.

## Keep going

We're building this thing together. Keep using the app, keep sharing what works and what doesnt. The more real-world usage we see, the better Domani becomes for everyone who values intentional productivity.

Task Rollover launches soon. You'll be the first to try it.

Talk soon,
