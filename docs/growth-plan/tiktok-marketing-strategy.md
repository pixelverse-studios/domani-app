- "POV: you actually wake up knowing exactly what to do"
- "The reason you're overwhelmed isn't what you think"

### Optimal Video Specifications

- **Aspect Ratio**: 9:16 vertical (mandatory)
- **Resolution**: 1080x1920 minimum
- **Length Sweet Spot**: 21-34 seconds for highest engagement
- **Text Overlays**: Essential for sound-off viewing
- **Captions**: Auto-generated or manual for accessibility
- **Hook**: Must appear in first 3 seconds

---

## Hashtag Strategy

### Primary Hashtags (Use 1-2)

- #productivity
- #morningroutine
- #planwithme
- #thatgirl
- #productivityhacks

### Secondary Hashtags (Use 2-3)

- #eveningroutine
- #timemanagement
- #studytok
- #gettingmylifetogether
- #dailyplanning
- #productiveday
- #goalsetting

### Niche Hashtags (Use 1-2)

- #planningtips
- #taskmanagement
- #mitmethod
- #nightroutine
- #intentionalliving

### Discovery Tags (Use 1)

- #fyp
- #foryou
- #foryoupage

**Total Hashtag Count**: 3-6 per video (avoid overcrowding)

**Important 2025-2026 Update**: TikTok's algorithm now prioritizes keywords in spoken audio and captions over hashtags. Include keywords naturally in your video script and on-screen text.

---

## Posting Schedule

### Optimal Posting Times

Based on 2025 data, productivity content performs best:

- **Weekday mornings**: 7-9 AM (morning routine seekers)
- **Weekday evenings**: 7-9 PM (evening routine planners)
- **Sunday evenings**: 7-10 PM (week-ahead planners)

**Hidden Opportunity**: Content posted 2-4 AM EST shows 60% higher engagement due to reduced competition.

### Posting Frequency

| Phase                 | Frequency | Goal                |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| Launch (Weeks 1-4)    | Daily     | Algorithm training  |
| Growth (Weeks 5-8)    | 5x/week   | Consistency signal  |
| Maintenance (Ongoing) | 3-4x/week | Sustainable quality |

**Critical**: Posting 3+ times per week consistently outperforms sporadic daily posting.

| --------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |

### Growth Budget (Monthly, Post-Launch)

| Category              | Budget           | Notes                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Ongoing Influencers   | $1,500-3,000     | 5-10 creators            |
| Spark Ads             | $1,000-2,000     | Continuous amplification |

### Expected Returns (Conservative)

At $2.50 CPI and $3,000 ad spend:

- 1,200 installs from paid
- 500-2,000 installs from organic/viral (variable)
- Total: 1,700-3,200 installs

**Pricing Model**: One-time purchase at $34.99 (early adopter price: $9.99 during public beta)

At 5% trial-to-purchase conversion (14-day free trial, no credit card required):

- 85-160 paying users from campaign
- Revenue at early adopter price ($9.99): $850-1,600
- Revenue at full price ($34.99): $2,970-5,600
- Payback: Immediate to 2 months at full price

**Viral Upside**: One viral video can generate 10,000+ installs at near-zero cost. Duolingo attributes 50+ million new users to TikTok presence. With a $34.99 one-time purchase, even a 3% conversion rate on 10,000 installs yields $10,500 in lifetime revenue.
