# Domani Pricing Strategy (Final Decision)

## Pricing Model Overview

Domani uses a **one-time purchase model** with a generous trial period. No subscriptions, no recurring fees, no tiered features.

### The Decision

| Element           | Decision                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Trial Period**  | 14 days (no credit card required)  |
| **Full Price**    | $34.99 USD (one-time, own forever) |
| **Early Adopter** | $9.99 USD (during public beta)     |
| **Subscription**  | None - one-time purchase only      |
| **Feature Tiers** | None - all features included       |
| **Updates**       | Forever                            |

## 1. Why $34.99

### Competitive Positioning

The $34.99 price point achieves several strategic goals:

1. **Undercuts major competitors significantly**:
   - 46% cheaper than Structured ($64.99)
   - 56% cheaper than Things 3 (~$80)
   - Equivalent to ~7 months of Todoist Pro ($5/month)
   - 82% cheaper than Sunsama annually ($192/year)

2. **"Fair value" perception**: Under $35 feels reasonable for a lifetime purchase, above $30 signals quality

3. **Healthy margins**: ~$24.50 net per sale after App Store's 30% cut

4. **Discount flexibility**: Room to offer sales without going too low

### Revenue Projections (50K downloads)

| Conversion | Purchases | Gross    | Net (after 30% fee) |
| ---------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| 6%         | 3,000     | $104,970 | $73,479             |
| 10%        | 5,000     | $174,950 | $122,465            |
| 12%        | 6,000     | $209,940 | $146,958            |

### Early Adopter Pricing: $9.99

During the public beta phase, Domani is offered at $9.99 - a 71% discount from full price. This achieves:

1. **Rewards early supporters**: Users taking a chance on a new app deserve a deal
2. **Maximizes initial user base**: Lower barrier drives adoption during critical launch phase
3. **Generates reviews quickly**: More users = more App Store reviews = better visibility
4. **Creates urgency**: "Beta pricing won't last forever" motivates action
5. **Word-of-mouth amplifier**: "It's only $10" is easy to recommend

**Early Adopter Revenue Projections (50K downloads)**

| Conversion | Purchases | Gross    | Net (after 30% fee) |
| ---------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| 15%        | 7,500     | $74,925  | $52,448             |
| 20%        | 10,000    | $99,900  | $69,930             |
| 25%        | 12,500    | $124,875 | $87,413             |

The lower per-sale revenue is offset by:

- Higher conversion rates at $9.99
- More reviews and social proof
- Larger user base for word-of-mouth growth
- Transition to $34.99 post-beta

## 2. Trial Length: 14 Days

### Why 14 Days is Optimal for Domani

1. **Habit formation**: Evening planning needs ~7-14 repetitions to become a natural routine
2. **Two full week cycles**: User experiences both weekday and weekend planning twice
3. **Reduces pressure**: Long enough to truly evaluate without feeling rushed
4. **Complex workflow**: Domani's evening planning philosophy requires time to appreciate
5. **No credit card required**: Removes friction; users can genuinely try before deciding

### Research Context

| Trial Length | User Sign-up Rate | Conversion Rate       | Notes                   |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 3-day        | 2%                | 35%                   | Too short to form habit |
| 7-day        | 22%               | 20-40%                | Industry standard       |
| **14-day**   | **Higher**        | **~25%**              | **Good for habit apps** |
| 30-day       | Lower             | Higher but 51% cancel | Decision fatigue        |

For an app centered on building an evening planning habit, 14 days provides the ideal balance of evaluation time and conversion urgency.

## 3. Post-Trial Behavior: Soft Lock with Grace Period

### How It Works

```
Day 1-14:  Full access (trial)
Day 15-21: Read-only mode with prominent upgrade banner
Day 22+:   Complete lock with "restore access" messaging
```

### Why This Approach

1. **Days 15-21 (Grace period)**: User sees their data, feels the loss, has time to budget/decide
2. **Day 22+ (Hard lock)**: Creates final urgency without feeling abrupt
3. **Messaging**: "Your 14 evening plans are waiting. Unlock them forever for $34.99"

### Push Notification Strategy

- Day 15: "Your trial ended, but your plans are safe. View them anytime."
- Day 17: "Missing your evening planning routine? Unlock Domani forever."
- Day 21: "Last chance: Your plans will be locked tomorrow. Keep them for $34.99"
- Day 22: "Your plans are now locked. Restore access anytime for $34.99"

### Why Not Complete Lock Immediately?

1. **Preserves user data investment**: User sees their history, feels loss of not continuing
2. **Lower friction to convert**: "Your data is waiting for you"
3. **Reduces uninstalls**: Users keep app installed, may convert later
4. **Re-engagement opportunity**: Can remind users of value they experienced

---

## 4. Update Policy: Forever

### The Promise

> "Buy once, get all future updates forever"

### Why Forever Updates

1. **Domani is intentionally simple**: This is an evening planning app, not a full productivity suite. The scope is naturally bounded.
2. **Marketing power**: "Own it forever" is a much stronger message than time-limited alternatives
3. **Competitive edge**: Things 3 charges for major versions. We don't.
4. **Trust building**: In an era of subscriptions, "forever" builds genuine loyalty
5. **Practical reality**: The commitment is to the core Domani app and its features

### Scope Caveat

> "All Domani features and updates, forever. If we build something entirely new (like Domani for Teams or Domani Web), that would be a separate product."

This provides flexibility for genuinely new products while honoring the "forever" promise for the core app.

---

## 5. Why No Subscriptions

### The Philosophy

Subscriptions create ongoing pressure - both for users (another monthly bill) and developers (constant feature churn to justify recurring cost). Domani is a focused tool that does one thing well. It doesn't need to become bloated to justify its existence.

### Benefits of One-Time Purchase

1. **User trust**: No surprise charges, no renewal anxiety
2. **Simpler relationship**: We build, you buy, everyone's happy
3. **Aligned incentives**: We make money when we deliver value, not when we retain
4. **Marketing clarity**: "Pay once, own forever" is simple and compelling
5. **Anti-subscription positioning**: Differentiates from Todoist, Sunsama, and other subscription apps

---

## 6. Why No Free Tier

### The Decision: All or Nothing

After the 14-day trial, Domani is either:

- **Unlocked**: Full access to everything, forever
- **Locked**: Read-only during grace period, then complete lock

There is no permanent free tier with limited features.

### Rationale

1. **Simplifies the product**: No need to artificially limit features or create upgrade friction
2. **Clear value proposition**: Trial lets you experience everything; purchase unlocks it permanently
3. **Prevents devaluation**: A "good enough" free tier undermines the paid offering
4. **Better user experience**: No constant upsell prompts or feature gates
5. **Sustainable business**: Every active user is a paying customer
