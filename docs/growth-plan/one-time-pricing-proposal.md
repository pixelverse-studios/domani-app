## Competitive Pricing Analysis

### One-Time Purchase Competitors

| App            | Price  | Platform    | Notes                                   |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Structured** | $64.99 | iOS/Android | Most similar competitor                 |
| **Things 3**   | ~$80   | Apple only  | $9.99 iPhone + $19.99 iPad + $49.99 Mac |
| **Streaks**    | $5.99  | Apple only  | Habit-only, very simple                 |
| **Forest**     | $3.99  | iOS         | Focus timer only                        |

### Subscription Competitors (Annual)

| App             | Annual | Monthly | Lifetime |
| --------------- | ------ | ------- | -------- |
| **Todoist Pro** | $60    | $5      | None     |
| **TickTick**    | $28-36 | $3      | None     |
| **Any.do**      | ~$96   | $7.99   | None     |
| **Sunsama**     | $192   | $20     | None     |

### Key Insight

Domani's current $99.99 lifetime is **more expensive than Structured ($64.99)** while offering less feature depth. A $34.99 one-time price would be:

- 46% cheaper than Structured
- 56% cheaper than Things 3
- Equivalent to ~7 months of Todoist Pro

## Recommended Pricing Model

### New Model: 14-Day Trial + One-Time Purchase

```
Trial Period: 14 days (full access, no credit card required)
Purchase Price: $34.99 USD (one-time, own forever)
Early Adopter Price (Public Beta): $9.99 USD
```

### Why $34.99?

1. **Psychological sweet spot**: Under $35 feels "accessible" for a productivity tool
2. **Competitive positioning**: Undercuts Structured ($64.99) by 46%
3. **Value perception**: Less than 7 months of Todoist Pro, but owned forever
4. **Research-backed**: Productivity apps in the $30-50 range see strong conversion
5. **Impulse-friendly**: Low enough to reduce purchase hesitation

### Why $9.99 Early Adopter Price?

During the public beta phase, we offer a significant discount to:

1. **Reward early believers**: Users who take a chance on a new app deserve recognition
2. **Generate reviews**: Lower barrier drives downloads and App Store reviews
3. **Build word-of-mouth**: "I got this amazing app for $10" spreads organically
4. **Validate pricing**: Test conversion at different price points before full launch

### Why 14-Day Trial?

| Trial Length | Sign-up Rate | Conversion Rate       |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------------- |
| 3-day        | 2%           | 35%                   |
| 7-day        | 22%          | 20-40%                |
| **14-day**   | **Higher**   | **~25%**              |
| 30-day       | Lower        | Higher but 51% cancel |

14-day trials work best for Domani:

- Long enough to form the evening planning habit (research shows habits take ~2 weeks)
- Allows users to experience multiple weekends and workweeks
- Reduces pressure while still maintaining conversion
- Higher sign-up rate due to generous trial length

### No Credit Card Required

Research shows:

- No CC required: 18-25% conversion (higher sign-up volume)
- CC required: 49-60% conversion (lower sign-up volume)

**Recommendation**: No credit card for trial. Higher sign-up volume + Domani's unique value proposition should drive conversion.

_Note: During public beta at $9.99, early revenue will be lower but conversion rates may be higher due to lower price point._

### Revenue Comparison

| ----------------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| Current (Subscription)  | $350,000       | Yes        |

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Changes Required

1. **Remove subscription logic** from RevenueCat integration
2. **Implement 14-day trial** tracking (start date in user profile)
3. **Add trial expiration UI** (countdown, upgrade prompts)
4. **Simplify paywall** to single purchase option
5. **Update App Store/Play Store** listings and pricing

### Trial Experience Design

**Day 1-7:** Full access, minimal interruption

- Subtle "X days left in trial" indicator
- Focus on habit formation (evening planning reminder)
- Let users experience full weekday + weekend cycles

**Day 8-11:** Gentle conversion prompts

- "You've planned 8 evenings! Keep the streak going."
- Highlight value received during trial
- Show habit streak building

**Day 12-14:** Urgency messaging

- "Your trial ends in X days"
- Clear upgrade CTA with price
- Emphasize "one-time, forever" value

**Post-Trial (if not converted):**

- App becomes read-only (can view past plans)
- Cannot create new plans
- Persistent but non-aggressive upgrade prompt
- Option to start new trial after 30 days? (consider)

### Pricing Localization

| Region          | Full Price | Early Adopter (Beta) |

## Risk Analysis

### Risks of One-Time Model

| Lower total revenue               | Medium     | Higher volume, lower friction                               |
| No recurring revenue              | Certain    | Plan for paid updates (Domani 2.0)                          |
| User expects free updates forever | High       | Clear messaging: "All current features + 1 year of updates" |

## Recommendation

**Proceed with one-time pricing at $34.99 with 14-day free trial. Launch at $9.99 early adopter price during public beta.**

### Rationale:

1. **Market timing**: Subscription fatigue is peaking; one-time purchase is a differentiator
2. **Competitive gap**: No major evening planning app offers one-time purchase
3. **Brand alignment**: "Own your mornings" messaging aligns with "own your app"
4. **Simplicity**: Easier to market, explain, and convert
5. **User trust**: "Pay once" builds goodwill and word-of-mouth
6. **Early adopter incentive**: $9.99 beta price rewards early users and generates reviews

---

1. [x] Finalize pricing: $34.99 full price, $9.99 early adopter (public beta)
2. [ ] Design 14-day trial expiration UX flow
3. [ ] Update RevenueCat/payment integration
