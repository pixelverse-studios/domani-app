## 2. Free/Organic Growth Tactics

### 2.1 App Store Optimization (ASO)

ASO drives up to 70% of app installs organically. This is the highest-ROI investment.

#### Key ASO Elements

**Title & Subtitle (iOS) / Title & Short Description (Android):**

- Secondary: "evening planning", "tomorrow planner", "daily routine", "task manager"
- Long-tail: "plan tomorrow's tasks", "evening productivity routine", "MIT task app"

**Screenshots & Videos:**

- First 2 screenshots are critical (shown in search results)
- Show the evening planning flow
- Include social proof (ratings, reviews) in visuals
- Video can increase conversion - keep to 30 seconds for App Store

**Ratings & Reviews:**

- Apps below 4 stars rarely get featured
- Target 4.2+ average rating
- Extra half-star can increase conversion by 25%
- Prompt for reviews after positive in-app moments (completed task, streak achievement)

**Localization:**

- Start with top 5 markets: US, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany
- Localized apps have higher featuring chances
- 79% of Today tab featured apps support iPhone AND iPad

#### ASO Tools Comparison

| Tool         | Best For                     | Cost                |

| Sensor Tower | Enterprise, deep data        | Premium             |
| AppFollow    | Review management            | Free tier available |

**Recommendation:** Start with App Radar free tier, upgrade to AppTweak when scaling.
