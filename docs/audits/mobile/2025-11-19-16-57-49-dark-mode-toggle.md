## Prompt Summary
Investigated why switching the in-app theme toggle to DARK updated the badge but the UI stayed in light mode.

## Actions Taken
1. Reviewed `ThemeProvider` to confirm how the theme state was resolved and supplied to components.
2. Identified that NativeWind never received the updated color scheme, so the global `dark` class was never applied.
3. Updated `ThemeProvider` to sync resolved theme changes with NativeWind’s color scheme API.

## Files Changed
- `src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` - Added NativeWind color-scheme integration so toggling modes updates the actual app styling.

## Components/Features Affected
- Theme switching UI (mode buttons and badge)
- All screens/styles relying on `dark:` Tailwind variants

## Testing Considerations
- Toggle between Light/Dark/Auto modes and confirm background/text colors change immediately.
- Verify that Auto tracks system appearance changes on both iOS and Android.
- Re-run on both platforms plus web (if used) to ensure no regressions.

## Performance Impact
- Negligible; only adds a lightweight effect to propagate theme changes.

## Next Steps
- Consider persisting the selected mode (AsyncStorage/SecureStore) so the preference survives restarts.
- Add automated tests or storybook coverage for theming if feasible.

## Notes
- NativeWind requires `darkMode: 'class'` (already configured) plus explicit `setColorScheme` calls when toggling manually.
