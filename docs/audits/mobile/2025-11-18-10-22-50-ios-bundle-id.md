## Prompt Summary

User received an Expo CLI warning stating the iOS bundleIdentifier must be added to the config.

## Actions Taken

1. Reviewed `app.json` and existing dynamic config to confirm there was no bundle identifier specified.
2. Added `bundleIdentifier: "com.baitedz.domani-app"` under the `ios` section of `app.json`.

## Files Changed

- `app.json` - Added the required `ios.bundleIdentifier` value while keeping existing settings intact.

## Components/Features Affected

- Expo configuration for iOS builds (bundle identification metadata).
- Downstream build & signing pipelines that rely on the bundle identifier.

## Testing Considerations

- Run `npx expo prebuild` or launch `npm run ios` to ensure Expo no longer warns about the missing bundle identifier.
- Verify the identifier matches the provisioning profile/app ID in Apple Developer if building for devices.

## Performance Impact

- None; config-only change.

## Next Steps

- Proceed with iOS build or simulator run after clearing the warning.
- Update provisioning/App Store Connect records if the identifier changes again in the future.

## Notes

Dynamic config remains simple; Expo CLI can now infer the bundle ID without prompting.
