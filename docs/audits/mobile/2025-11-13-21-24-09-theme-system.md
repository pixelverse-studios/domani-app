# Audit Log - Mobile App - 2025-11-13 21:24:09

## Prompt Summary

Set up a light and dark mode design system with reusable primitives.

## Actions Taken

1. Reviewed the project rules in `agents.md` related to theming.
2. Defined theme tokens, mode types, and exported helpers for reuse across the app.
3. Implemented a configurable `ThemeProvider`, hook, and base UI components (Text, Surface, Button).
4. Added a theme demo screen with navigation integration and wrapped the app with the provider.

## Files Changed

- `App.tsx` - wrapped the tree with `ThemeProvider`, added themed status bar management.
- `src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` - created the theme context, store, and provider logic.
- `src/hooks/useTheme.ts` - exposed a convenience hook for accessing the current theme and updater.
- `src/providers/AuthProvider.tsx` - stubbed the provider so the app renders.
- `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` - introduced a stack navigator that renders the demo screen with themed colors.
- `src/screens/ThemeDemoScreen.tsx` - built a UI surface to exercise the tokens and switch theme preferences.
- `src/components/ui/Text.tsx` - themed typography wrapper that respects tone and variant selections.
- `src/components/ui/Button.tsx` - button primitive with variants, sizes, and loading states.
- `src/components/ui/Surface.tsx` - background container component handling padding, radius, and elevation.
- `src/theme/types.ts` `src/theme/tokens.ts` `src/theme/index.ts` - defined the underlying design tokens and theme getters.
- `docs/audits/mobile/2025-11-13-21-24-09-theme-system.md` - recorded this work.

## Components/Features Affected

- Theme design system primitives
- Navigation container styling
- Demo screen showcasing tokens

## Testing Considerations

- Verify the theme preference toggle updates instantly on both iOS and Android.
- Confirm navigation colors switch correctly between modes.
- Check accessibility contrast for text and button variants in each theme.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal; adds lightweight context + zustand store with no heavy computations.
- Components reuse shared tokens to avoid redundant styles.

## Next Steps

- Persist theme preference via AsyncStorage or MMKV.
- Integrate actual authentication and feature screens once available.
- Expand the design system with inputs, cards, and badges.

## Notes

- Unable to run TypeScript checks because dependencies are not installed in this workspace environment.
