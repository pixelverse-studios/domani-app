## Prompt Summary
User reported an Expo CLI warning requiring the Android `package` value to be defined.

## Actions Taken
1. Checked `app.json` to confirm the Android package name was missing.
2. Added `package: "com.baitedz.domaniapp"` within the `android` section.

## Files Changed
- `app.json` - Inserted the Android package identifier alongside the existing adaptive icon configuration.

## Components/Features Affected
- Android build metadata and application ID used for signing/deployment.

## Testing Considerations
- Re-run `npm run android` or `npx expo prebuild` to verify the warning is resolved.
- Ensure the package matches Google Play console/App Signing setup when producing release builds.

## Performance Impact
- None; configuration update only.

## Next Steps
- Continue with Android builds now that the identifier is configured.
- Update this value if the package name changes in store listings.

## Notes
The project’s dynamic config (`app.config.ts`) now receives the Android package metadata from `app.json`, preventing Expo from attempting automatic writes.
