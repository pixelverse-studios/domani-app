# Audit Log - Mobile App - 2025-11-18 08:59:47

## Prompt Summary
Resolve the `npm install` failure caused by conflicting React/React DOM peer dependencies after the previous lockfile was removed.

## Actions Taken
1. Updated `package.json` to pin `react-dom` to `18.2.0`, matching the React version required by React Native 0.73.
2. Attempted to regenerate `package-lock.json` via `npm install --package-lock-only`, but the sandbox timed out (180s limit). Highlighted that the user should run `npm install` locally to recreate the lockfile.

## Files Changed
- `package.json` - Set `react-dom` to `18.2.0` (without the caret) to satisfy React Native’s peer dependency constraints.

## Components/Features Affected
- Dependency management / Expo tooling

## Testing Considerations
- After pulling the change, run `npm install` locally to regenerate `package-lock.json` and confirm dependencies install cleanly.
- Start Expo (`npm run start`) to verify Metro bundling works with the restored dependencies.

## Performance Impact
- None; dependency version pin only.

## Next Steps
- User should run `npm install` (or `npm install --package-lock-only`) locally to create a fresh lockfile, then re-run the dev server.
- Commit the regenerated `package-lock.json` alongside this change.

## Notes
- Sandbox execution limits prevented generating a new lockfile here.
