# Audit Log - Mobile App - $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

## Prompt Summary
Reviewed the AGENTS.md guidelines, bootstrapped the Expo-based workspace, installed baseline dependencies, and implemented the first iteration of the Domani design system with tokens, theming, and reusable components.

## Actions Taken
1. Initialized npm metadata, installed Expo/React Native plus supporting libs (NativeWind, React Query, Zustand, etc.).
2. Added Expo + Metro configuration (app.json, app.config.ts, metro.config.js) with NativeWind integration and global CSS variables.
3. Created strict TypeScript + Tailwind configs, Theme provider/store/hooks, and foundational tokens for colors, spacing, typography, and radii.
4. Built base UI primitives (Button, Card, Badge, Input, Text) and a demo screen in `src/app/index.tsx` showing the design system usage.
5. Documented the system under docs/technical/design-system.md and ran `npm run typecheck` for validation.

## Files Changed
- `package.json` - Converted to Expo Router entry, added scripts, and declared dependencies/devDependencies.
- `app.json`, `app.config.ts`, `metro.config.js` - Set Expo metadata, router root, and NativeWind bundler config.
- `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, `global.css`, `nativewind-env.d.ts` - Enabled strict TS paths and CSS-variable based theming for NativeWind.
- `src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx`, `src/hooks/useTheme.ts`, `src/stores/themeStore.ts`, `src/stores/uiStore.ts` - Added theme/UI state with context hook exposure.
- `src/theme/**` - Added shared color, spacing, typography, and radius tokens plus consolidated exports.
- `src/components/ui/*` - Implemented Button, Card, Input, Badge, Text primitives with variant support.
- `src/app/_layout.tsx`, `src/app/index.tsx` - Wired providers and demo screen showcasing the design system and tier philosophy constants.
- `src/utils/constants.ts`, `docs/technical/design-system.md`, `assets/*.png` - Captured product philosophy data, documentation, and placeholder assets.

## Components/Features Affected
- Design system foundations (theme tokens, providers, UI primitives)
- Expo Router layout and entry screen scaffolding
- NativeWind/Tailwind styling pipeline

## Testing Considerations
- Run `npm run typecheck` (already passing) after modifying shared tokens or provider APIs.
- Launch via `npm start` / Expo Go on both iOS and Android to verify NativeWind styling + theme switching.
- Validate theme toggles, button states, and CSS variables across light/dark modes.

## Performance Impact
- Adds baseline dependencies (~1300 packages) typical for Expo + NativeWind stack.
- UI primitives use lightweight Tailwind classes; no expensive runtime calculations yet.
- Lists/demos are static; FlashList dependency ready for future task views.

## Next Steps
- Flesh out additional primitives (Surface, Tabs, Toast) and connect Supabase/auth flows.
- Implement actual planning/execution screens using the new components.
- Add automated linting/formatting and CI scripts once repo wiring is finalized.

## Notes
Unable to create a PR because this workspace is not a git repository. Ensure repo initialization + remote origin exist before running `gh pr create`.
